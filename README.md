# PasswordStore Audit

This repo showcases the work done in the third lesson of the Cyfrin Updraft Security & Auditing course. In this lesson I undertook my first audit. The main goal here was to learn the auditing process from end to end and how to make a professional report. The results can be seen in `audit-data/2024-02-11-passwordStore-audit.pdf`.
